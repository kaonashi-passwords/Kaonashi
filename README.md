## Kaonashi Project: RootedCON 2019
This repository contains several directories: <br>

 * Sorted ***Masks*** for hashcat
 * Advanced ***Rules*** for hashcat
 * Links and torrent files to download the Kaonishi's ***Wordlists***
 * ***Slides*** used in our talk [I know your p4$$w0rd (and if I don't, I will guess it...](https://www.slideshare.net/segofensiva/i-know-your-p4w0rd-and-if-i-dont-i-will-guess-it-139829304) at [RootedCON (2019)](https://rootedcon.com/)

## Why
When a user has to choose a password, he tends to build it in the same way, using the same personal information, and using the same complexity ideas.

In this study we processed several billions of real passwords in order to make a large-scale analysis of these common behaviors, drawing conclusions that allow us to create specific procedures and tools to improve current Password Cracking techniques.

## How
We used different methods, like behavioral and statistical analysis, neural networks and other advanced techniques, to obtain patterns and relevant information that allow us to crack hashes whose resistance is usually quite high.

## Kaonashi Wordlist
These wordlist has been extracted from real password leaksa, and sorted by number of ocurrences. By having this wordlists sorted this way, users can extract TOP _n_ lines/passwords and create custom wordlists based on their needs.

For our study, we created the original wordlist and two additional ones:

 * [Kaonashi14M](): top 14 million passwords (same size as RockYou.txt for comparation)
 * [KaonashiWPA](): password length > 20 characters (WPA password cracking)
